One of the ways in which lists can be used are in representing multi-dimension objects such as matrices. 
Matrices can be represented as a list of lists in Python. 
For example a 5 x 5 matrix with values 0 to 4 in each row can be written as:

matrix = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]
          
Code:
matrix = [[col for col in range(5)] for row in range(5)]
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
