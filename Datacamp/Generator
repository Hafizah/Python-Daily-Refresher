a generator is like a list comprehension except it does not store the list in memory: 
it does not construct the list, but is an object we can iterate over to produce elements of the list as required.


# Create generator object: 
result = (num for num in range(31))

# Print the first 5 values --------------------prints out 0,1,2,3,4
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))

# Print the rest of the values
for value in result:
    print(value)
