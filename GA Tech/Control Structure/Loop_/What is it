A loop is a control structure that repeats some lines of code until a certain condition is met.
We don't just have to copy and paste chunks of code if we want to do something more than once.
Two kinds of common loops-- for loops and while loops.
Anything you can do with a for loop you can also do with a while loop. 
However, each one is better suited to certain kinds of tasks.
